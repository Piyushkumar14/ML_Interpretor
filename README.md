# ML interpreter

Blackblox ML classifiers visually explained

## About

ML interpreter demonstrates auto-interpretability of machine learning models in a codeless environment.

Currently it focuses on high-performance blackbox tree ensemble models (random forest, XGBoost and lightGBM) for binary/multi-class classifications on tabular data, though the framework has the capability to extend to other models, other prediction types (regression), and other data types such as text/image.

It provides interpretation at both global and local levels:

- At global level, it indicates feature importance
- At local level, one can view how features affect individual predictions

## How it works

### Key features

- demo data/upload a small csv (a demo csv included in the github folder)
- choose among algorithms
- data preview and classification report
- global/local interpretations
- inspect misclassified data

To view how individual classification decision is made, one can toggle which datapoint to view.

Note: If preprocessing is needed, it is recommended to preprocess the data prior to the upload, since the app does not provide automatic data cleaning.
